Python Scripting 

1. Write Python scripts for basic file operations and data processing? 


# File: file_operations.py

# Step 1: Create and write data into a file
with open("data.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Python is a powerful programming language.\n")
    file.write("It is widely used for data analysis and automation.\n")
    file.write("File handling in Python is simple and effective.\n")

# Step 2: Read the content from the file
with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.readlines()

# Step 3: Process the data - count lines and words
line_count = len(content)
word_count = sum(len(line.split()) for line in content)

print("File Content:")
for line in content:
    print(line.strip())

print("\nTotal Lines:", line_count)
print("Total Words:", word_count)



2. Develop a simple web scraper to extract data from a website? 


# File: web_scraper.py

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Step 1: Send an HTTP request to the website
url = "https://www.example.com"
response = requests.get(url)

# Step 2: Parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

# Step 3: Extract headlines (usually within <h3> tags)
headlines = soup.find_all('h3')

# Step 4: Display the extracted headlines
print("Latest example Headlines:\n")
for i, headline in enumerate(headlines[:10], 1):  # limiting to first 10
    print(f"{i}. {headline.text.strip()}")
