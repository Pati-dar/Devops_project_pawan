1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?

Answer:
A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and is defined using the def keyword. It can exist independently and can be called by its name.
A method is similar to a function but is associated with an object and defined within a class. Methods can modify the object’s state or access its data.

2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.

Answer:

Parameters are the variable names listed in a function definition.
Arguments are the actual values passed to the function when it is called.



3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?

Answer:
There are several ways to define and call functions in Python:

Normal function

Lambda (anonymous) function

Using default arguments

Using keyword arguments


4. What is the purpose of the return statement in a Python function?

Answer:
The return statement is used to send a value back to the part of the program that called the function. Without return, the function returns None by default.



5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?

Answer:

An iterable is an object capable of returning its members one at a time (e.g., lists, tuples, strings).

An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data; it is created using the iter() function and produces elements one at a time using next().



6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.

Answer:
A generator is a special type of function that yields items one at a time using the yield keyword instead of return. It produces values lazily (only when requested), which saves memory.



7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?

Answer:
Advantages of generators:

Memory efficient: They don’t store all items in memory at once.

Lazy evaluation: They generate values only when needed.

Useful for large data processing.


8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?

Answer:
A lambda function is an anonymous, single-line function defined using the lambda keyword. It is typically used when a simple function is needed temporarily, such as inside map(), filter(), or sort().



9. Explain the purpose and usage of the map() function in Python.

Answer:
The map() function applies a given function to each item of an iterable (like a list) and returns a map object (which can be converted to a list).

Syntax:
map(function, iterable)


10. What is the difference between map(), reduce(), and filter() functions in Python?

Answer:

Function	Purpose	Returns	Example
map()	Applies a function to each item	All results	map(lambda x: x*2, [1,2,3]) → [2,4,6]
filter()	Filters items that meet a condition	Matching items	filter(lambda x: x>2, [1,2,3,4]) → [3,4]
reduce()	Reduces all items to a single value	Single result	reduce(lambda x,y: x+y, [1,2,3,4]) → 10


1. Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list.

Answer:
This function checks each number in the list, and if it is even, adds it to the total sum.

Program:

def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    return sum(num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0)

# Example
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print("Sum of even numbers:", sum_even_numbers(nums))


Output:

Sum of even numbers: 12

2. Create a Python function that accepts a string and returns the reverse of that string.

Answer:
We can reverse a string using slicing.

Program:

def reverse_string(s):
    return s[::-1]

# Example
text = "Python"
print("Reversed string:", reverse_string(text))


Output:

Reversed string: nohtyP

3. Implement a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing the squares of each number.

Answer:
We use a list comprehension to generate a list of squares.

Program:

def square_list(numbers):
    return [x ** 2 for x in numbers]

# Example
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print("Squares:", square_list(nums))


Output:

Squares: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

4. Write a Python function that checks if a given number is prime or not from 1 to 200.

Answer:
A prime number is divisible only by 1 and itself.

Program:

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Check prime numbers from 1 to 200
primes = [x for x in range(1, 201) if is_prime(x)]
print("Prime numbers from 1 to 200:\n", primes)


Output:

Prime numbers from 1 to 200:
[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ..., 199]

5. Create an iterator class in Python that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.

Answer:
The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each next number is the sum of the previous two.

Program:

class Fibonacci:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n
        self.a, self.b = 0, 1
        self.count = 0

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.count < self.n:
            result = self.a
            self.a, self.b = self.b, self.a + self.b
            self.count += 1
            return result
        else:
            raise StopIteration

# Example
for num in Fibonacci(10):
    print(num, end=" ")


Output:

0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

6. Write a generator function in Python that yields the powers of 2 up to a given exponent.

Answer:
We can use yield to generate values one by one.

Program:

def powers_of_two(n):
    for i in range(n + 1):
        yield 2 ** i

# Example
for val in powers_of_two(5):
    print(val)


Output:

1
2
4
8
16
32
64

7. Implement a generator function that reads a file line by line and yields each line as a string.

Answer:
This generator reads large files efficiently without loading the whole file into memory.

Program:

def read_file_line_by_line(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            yield line.strip()

# Example (assuming "sample.txt" exists)
for line in read_file_line_by_line("sample.txt"):
    print(line)


Output (if sample.txt has lines):

Line 1
Line 2
Line 3

8. Use a lambda function in Python to sort a list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple.

Answer:
We can use the sorted() function with a lambda key.

Program:

data = [(1, 5), (3, 2), (2, 8), (4, 1)]
sorted_data = sorted(data, key=lambda x: x[1])
print("Sorted list:", sorted_data)


Output:

Sorted list: [(4, 1), (3, 2), (1, 5), (2, 8)]

9. Write a Python program that uses map() to convert a list of temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

Answer:
Formula: Fahrenheit = (Celsius × 9/5) + 32

Program:

celsius = [0, 20, 37, 100]
fahrenheit = list(map(lambda c: (c * 9/5) + 32, celsius))
print("Temperatures in Fahrenheit:", fahrenheit)


Output:

Temperatures in Fahrenheit: [32.0, 68.0, 98.6, 212.0]

10. Create a Python program that uses filter() to remove all the vowels from a given string.

Answer:
We use filter() with a lambda function to exclude vowels.

Program:

def remove_vowels(text):
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    return ''.join(filter(lambda ch: ch not in vowels, text))

# Example
string = "Beautiful Day"
print("Without vowels:", remove_vowels(string))


Output:

Without vowels: Btfl Dy
