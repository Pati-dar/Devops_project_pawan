1. Implement unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for a sample application using frameworks like JUnit, TestNG, or Selenium? 

Unit Testing (JUnit):

I wrote simple test cases for a Calculator class that performs add, subtract, multiply, and divide functions.

Example:

@Test
void testAddition() {
    assertEquals(10, calc.add(6, 4));
}


This checks if each function gives the correct result.

Integration Testing:

I created another class MathService that uses the Calculator class.

The test checked whether both classes work correctly together.

Example result: For inputs (2,3), output = 11 â†’ means integration is working.

End-to-End Testing (Selenium):

I used Selenium WebDriver to open a website and verify its title.

Example:

driver.get("https://www.example.com");
assertEquals("Example Domain", driver.getTitle());


This ensures the complete workflow (browser + application) works as expected.

Conclusion:
All three tests (unit, integration, and E2E) ran successfully.
Tools used: JUnit 5, Selenium WebDriver, Java, and Maven.
